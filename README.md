# Deep-Learning-Based Signature Forgery Detection for Personal Identity Authentication
## Introduction  

Handwritten signatures continue to serve as a widely accepted form of identity verification across domains such as banking, legal documentation, and governmental services. However, the increasing sophistication of forgery techniques presents serious challenges to the reliability of traditional verification systems, which are often rule-based or reliant on handcrafted features.

To address these limitations, this project presents a deep learning-based framework for offline signature forgery detection, leveraging a Triplet Siamese Similarity Network (tSSN) trained with triplet loss. The proposed system integrates three key components:
- **YOLOv10**: efficient signature localization from scanned document images.
- **ResNet-34**: the feature extractor to generate robust, high-dimensional embeddings of signature images.
- **Triplet Network with Triplet Loss**: learn a discriminative embedding space that enforces minimal distance between genuine signature pairs and maximal distance from forgeries.

A novel contribution of this work is the integration of multiple distance metrics—including Euclidean, Cosine, Manhattan, and a learnable distance function—to investigate how similarity definitions affect verification performance. Experimental results show that using Euclidean distance with a margin of 0.6 achieves the highest accuracy of 95.6439% on the CEDAR dataset, significantly outperforming previous benchmarks.

The system is trained using balanced batch sampling, enabling dynamic construction of hard and semi-hard triplets during training and improving model generalization across diverse handwriting styles. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, FAR, FRR, and EER.

This project offers a scalable, accurate, and generalizable solution for signature-based identity authentication, with direct applicability in high-security environments such as banking, finance, and legal processes.

## **Features**
- Offline signature forgery detection based on deep metric learning.
- Signature region localization using YOLOv10.
- Embedding extraction via ResNet-34 backbone.
- Metric learning with Triplet Loss using four distance modes:
  - **Euclidean distance**
  - **Cosine distance**
  - **Manhattan distance**
  - **Learnable distance**
- Evaluation with accuracy, ROC-AUC, EER, precision, recall.
- Experimental margin tuning: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0].
- Balanced batch sampling for consistent triplet generation.

## **Usage**
**- To train, evaluate, and analyze the Triplet Siamese Signature Network (tSSN), follow the steps below:**
1. **Prepare your input dataset:**
- Place raw document images into a folder `(e.g. data/raw_documents/)` if you're using YOLO for signature localization.
2. **Localize signature regions using YOLOv10:**
- Open and run the notebook `notebooks/yolov10-bcsd_training.ipynb`.
- This will detect and crop the signature regions from input documents and save them into a designated output directory `(e.g. data/signatures/)`.
3. **Configure model settings and experiment parameters:**
- Open `configs/config_tSSN.yaml`.
- Modify parameters as needed:
  - `distance_mode: choose from euclidean, cosine, manhattan, learnable`
  - `margin: set values like 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1.0`
  - `feature_dim, batch_size, epochs, and other hyperparameters`
4. **Train the Triplet Siamese Network (tSSN)**
- Open and run the notebook `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`.
- The training loop will:
  - Use `tSSN_trainloader.py` for balanced triplet sampling.
  - Build the model from `Triplet_Siamese_Similarity_Network.py`.
  - Apply the selected loss from `triplet_loss.py`.
5. **Evaluate model performance:**
- Run the notebook `notebooks/final_evaluation.ipynb` to:
- Compute accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Compare performance across distance modes and margin values.
- Visualize ROC curves and embedding spaces.
6. **Analyze and interpret results:**
- Evaluation results will be printed inside the notebook.
- You can export plots or metrics to `results/` if desired.
- ROC curves and distance distribution plots can be found in the output cells of `final_evaluation.ipynb`.
